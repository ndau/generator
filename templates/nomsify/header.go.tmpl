// Adding new fields to a nomsify-able struct:
//
// Managed vars are useful for adding new fields that are marshaled to noms only after they're
// first set, so that app hashes aren't affected until the new fields are actually needed.
//
// A managed vars map is a hash map whose keys are managed variable names.
// The `managedVars map[string]struct{}` field must be manually declared in the struct.
//
// Declare new fields using the "managedVar" prefix.  e.g. `managedVarSomething SomeType`.
// GetSomething() and SetSomething() are generated for public access to the new field.
//
// Once SetSomething() is called for the first time, typically as a result of processing a new
// transaction that uses it, the managed vars map will contain "Something" as a key and the
// value of managedVarSomething will be stored in noms on the next call to MarshalNoms().
// Until then, all new managedVar fields will retain their "zero" values.
